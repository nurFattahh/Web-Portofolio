    description:
      "Fatiguard is a wearable monitoring system designed to detect early signs of fatigue in workers, especially in high-risk environments like construction sites. The device collects physiological data such as heart rate (via ECG sensor) and body temperature, processes it using a lightweight AI model deployed on an ESP32 microcontroller, and gives real-time feedback. The goal is to prevent overexertion-related accidents. I was responsible for system integration, model deployment, and communication between edge devices and the gateway.",

    description: "This project is a real-time accident detection system developed using ESP32. It monitors acceleration data from an onboard accelerometer to detect abnormal motion patterns that may indicate a collision or accident. When an incident is detected, the device immediately sends a notification to a designated Telegram chat via a bot using HTTP API calls. This allows family members or emergency responders to be promptly informed. The system is designed to be compact, cost-effective, and easily integrated into personal vehicles or wearables for workers in hazardous environments.",
